She's getting ready for the christmas party. She turns around in her chair as she sees you through the mirror and smiles widely when she sees you holding her wand.

        <div class="modal-body">Hey there friend! I am almost ready for the party. I can’t wait to open my gift from you. Oh, and you found my wand! Thank you so much! Draco took it from me after I told him I wouldn’t help him with his homework. Also thank you for letting me borrow the invisibility cloak. It went missing for a while but maybe it was just the fact that it's... invisible. I returned it to the Gryffindor common room. See you at the party!
