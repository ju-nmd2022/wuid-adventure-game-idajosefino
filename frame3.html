        <p class="paragraph1">Ida perfectly described your gift to Luna. <em>Draco</em> had been holding it. He must be the thief. You need to get inside the Slytherin common room to get it back. However being a Gryffindor, you can't just waltz inside. The door is also locked. You think hard about it on your way to the Ravenclaw common room.
            You find Luna getting ready in front of a mirror as you enter the girl's dormitory. She smiles as she sees you.

        <div class="modal-body">Hiya there. I am almost ready for the party. I canâ€™t wait to open my gift from you!<br><br>Oh the book of sneaky spells! Yeah I have been waiting for Ida to finish it, but I no longer need it. The door to greenhouse three was open this time and by using the invisibility cloak I could pet the mandrakes without getting detention again. You can keep the book if you like.<br><br>
            I know you must be busy finishing up for the party but before you leave; I found a rare sickle in the <em>library</em> yesterday. I challenge you to a coin toss! I choose tails.<br><br>
