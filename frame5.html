        <p class="paragraph1">You walk down the moving stairscases and take a left towards the kitchens. You're not hungry, you are heading for the Hufflepuff common room. The room is light and filled with plants. You find the Hufflepuff prefect packing her bags to head home over the holidays. You should talk to her and see if she has any information for you.

        <div class="modal-body">Hello there! Oh the book! It's loooong overdue, I even got a howler-notice from the <em>library</em>... I have been looking everywhere for it. I must have dropped it while bumping into Draco in the Room of requirements earlier. He dropped his wand in a hurry out of there. I heard it's so powerful it can open the slytherin common room without any passwords or spells. Hm... Anyway, Luna wanted to loan the book after me, would you mind giving it to her? I am running a bit late to catch the train home over the holiday. Thank you and merry christmas!</div>
