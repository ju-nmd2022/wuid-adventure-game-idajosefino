        <div class="modal-body">Hello there! Oh you found the book of sneaky spells. I have been looking everywhere for it. I must have dropped it while bumping into Draco Malfoy earlier today. He was in a real hurry carrying a green and red Christmas gift. I never would have imagined him buying anyone anything...<br><br> Anyways, I was wondering if you could give the book to Luna Lovegood? You are friends right? She wanted to loan it after me but I am in a hurry to catch the train home over the holidays.<br><br> Thank you and Merry Christmas!</div>
